Simple Programming Problems solved with crystal programming language.
Most of the exercises are made to be easy and libraries are supposed to be not required.
Of course some of it depends on your programming language.

If you're interested doing it yourself, here's a template: https://github.com/manemobiili/spp feel free to remove .gitignore files.

[WIP] These exercises need improvement
- 01_elementary/06_mathProduct.cr doesn't calculate product numbers
- 02_listsStrings/04_oddList.cr only works with specific circumstances, start with even number or 0, no missing numbers from list
- 02_listsStrings/07_funkySumForLoop.cr is missing - crystal doesn't support for-loops by design (IIRC)
